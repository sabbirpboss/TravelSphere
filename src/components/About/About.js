        Hi there! Becoming a computer programmer would be great because there are many
        options in this career by having the ability to produce an operating
        system, or a game for the world. Computer programmers have many
        opportunities in life to find a job they would love. Programmers can
        work independently, or in a big company. Programmers have and are
        creating the future for computers. Computer programmers have a wide
        range on what they can do. Computer programmers write the detailed list
        of instructions the computer will follow in the software (Great Sample
        Resume). This is also called “coding.” Programmers test their software,
        or other peoples, to see if it works properly (Career Cruising).   
        Programmers study the tasks that the program wil show more content. The
        programmer will either have to go to the business or the home in some
        sort of transportation, or by using his own computer. If the programmer
        is working on certain software for his clients, then he may have built
        it in a way to assist them from his computer.
